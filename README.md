ALL giphys are shown as STILL when the app loads them. In order to see the animated version, the user most click on the 
giphy to animate it.

There are some pre-defined buttons on the left hand side that users cna click to generate some giphys on those topics.

Everytime the user clicks on a button, it will query the next 10 giphys in that topic so that the user alwyas gets 
a non-repeating batch of giphys. The most recently show giphys will always be shown first in the giphy array.

When the user enters the name of a giphy and clicks on add, that button will be added to the topics button so that the 
user can use it to quickly search giphys under that topic.
